# ConnectCard

ConnectCard is a mobile application that allows users to scan, store, and manage their name cards digitally. Designed for recruiters, professionals, job seekers, and everyone else. Simplify networking, all in one place.

## Description

ConnectCard utilizes Firebase for data storage and manipulation, and Flutter for the user interface design. It offers various features such as scanning and storing name card information, linking the app to communication platforms like Telegram, Whatsapp, Phone, and Email, updating existing data, NFC technology for easy name card exchange, and a membership/reward card feature.

### Problem:

Carrying physical name cards and membership/loyalty cards can be burdensome, leading to lost contact information and a cluttered wallet. It is inconvenient for individuals who meet new people, engage in business interactions, or collect various membership cards to manage and access these cards efficiently.

### Need:

There is a need for a digital platform that allows users to store and manage their personal name cards, as well as name cards from others or businesses. Additionally, users require a solution to store and access membership or loyalty reward cards without the need for physical cards.

### Solution:

Our mobile application provides a convenient solution by allowing users to scan physical name cards using their phone camera and convert them into digital cards stored within the application. Users can easily update their personal digital name cards, keeping their contact information up to date for seamless interactions. The application also enables users to exchange digital name cards effortlessly using NFC technology. Furthermore, users can store and track their membership or loyalty reward cards digitally, while vendors can update customers' progress in real-time. With our app, individuals can simplify their wallet, stay connected with ease, and take full advantage of membership benefits without the hassle of physical cards.
